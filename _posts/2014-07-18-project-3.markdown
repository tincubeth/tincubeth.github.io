client: Geth over Tor wih Slock.it Incubed
category: Tincubeth
description: Docker container that when run starts an Slock.it Incubed Server on the Görli Testnet using the private key of a demo Ethereum account, a Geth (Go Ethereum) Blockchain Client Node on the Görli Testnet, and a Tor Network Service. The Docker container is configured so that the Incubed Service exposes port 9050 over TCP that is only accessible to the Tor Network Service as a Socks Proxy since we do not want to map any ports to the host machine.
